              </p>
              <p className="text-justify mt-2">
                A cover letter is a one-page document you send with your resume
                that provides additional information about skills and
                experiences related to the job you're pursuing. It typically
                includes three to four short paragraphs. A cover letter is
                important because it serves as the first chance for the
                recruiter to see the qualifications that make you a good fit for
                the position. Not every job application requires a cover letter,
                but it's a good idea to submit one. The extra effort not only
                shows the employer that you're serious about the job, but the
                letter differentiates you from other candidates.

                A cover letter is typically written by a job applicant as part
                of their application process. It is a personalized document that
                complements the resume or CV and is used to introduce the
                applicant to a potential employer.
